# Using SedEdu

![SedEdu main screen and category page.](https://github.com/sededu/sededu/raw/develop/.jose/figures/sededu_main_and_category.png)

* The SedEdu framework organizes modules into five categories (Figure 1, left): "Rivers and deltas", "Landscapes", "Deserts", "Coasts", and "Stratigraphy". 
* Clicking on a category button brings the user to that category page, where the available modules (and associated metadata and activities) are listed (Figure 1, right).
* Pressing the button "Run module" will launch the module selected, and "Open activity" will open the activity on the users computer (typically a .pdf file).


## Some ideas on ways to use it

* on the board, used by instructor
* on class computers with an activity
* home-schooling
* problem sets for homework
